Factors Influencing Loan Approval

The following factors are considered when determining loan approval, which is the dependent variable in this project:

- Applicant Income: Applicants with higher income levels generally have a greater likelihood of loan approval.
- Credit History: A strong repayment history on previous loans positively impacts the chances of approval.
- Requested Loan Amount: Smaller loan amounts are typically associated with higher approval rates.
- Loan Term: Loans with shorter repayment periods and lower principal amounts are more likely to be approved.
- Equated Monthly Instalment (EMI): Lower monthly repayment obligations increase the probability of loan approval.
